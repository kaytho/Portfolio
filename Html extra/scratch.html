      <h2> Random Facts</h2>
      <p> In the past, I've studied karate, kungfu, and judo. The piano and I are in a love-hate relationship. I speak a bit of Spanish,  I tend to be pretty decent when I've spent a little time with people who speak the language, other times I'm not so good. I think Kevin Hart is hillarious. I'm goofy, I'm serious, and fun follows me. I studied Economics and International Business. Rollercoasters and I are a match made in heaven and I totally want to go skydiving.
      Based off of my random facts, see if you can guess which of the following are true. </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:none">

      <li> Hangliding is a lot of fun, something I'd definitely like to do again</li>
        <button onclick="Javascript:alert('No I have not been but it is something I would like to do in the future.')">
          I predict the future, you're going to find out the answer
        </button>

      <li> My judo instructor was a little insane <li>
        <button onclick="Javascript:alert('He really was he once slammed a yardstick on our nails because our                       short nails were supposedly too long.')">
          Click me, I dare you!
        </button>
      <li>I can play Bethoven and Mozart as well as many popular songs</li>
        <button onclick="Javascript:alert('No of course not, we have a love hate relationship.')">
